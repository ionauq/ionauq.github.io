Even Fibonacci numbers
=======

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#### 偶数斐波纳契数

斐波那契数列中的每一项都是前两项的和。从1和2开始的前10项斐波那契数列为：

 ```
 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 ```

考虑斐波那契数列中项不超过400万，求项偶数的项之和。

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int firstNumber = 0;
        int secondNumber = 1;
        int total = 0;
        int currentNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber;
        while (currentNumber < 4000000) {
            if (currentNumber % 2 == 0) {
                total += currentNumber;
            }

            firstNumber = secondNumber;
            secondNumber = currentNumber;
            currentNumber = firstNumber + secondNumber;
        }

        System.out.println(total);
    }
```
